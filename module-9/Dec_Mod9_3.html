        <h2>Chapter 1: Reflections</h2>
        <p class="intro">Sometimes, when I find myself in between tasks at my second job, I find myself <span id = "wondering">_______</span> how I got here and why I am not where I thought I should be at this point of my life. I could say it started when I left high school for college. I could say it started when I flunked out of college. Or I could say that this just might be how things were meant to play out for me. <span class="sentence">All I know though, is that sometimes I wonder if what could have been is what should have been.</span></p>
        <p>Growing up, learning had always come fairly easy to me. I was always able to pick up some new skills or ideas fairly quickly and without much difficulty. I graduated high school with a 4.3 GPA and enough college credits from passing AP exams to basically be a sophomore. I <span id = "failed">_______</span> to realize however that my ability to learn and excel relied a lot more on my environment than I considered.</p>
        <p>After graduating from high school, the plan was for me to come out and live with my uncle so I could attend San Francisco State University, earn a bachelor's in a science field and then work towards <span id = "medical">_______</span> school. Tragically though, I came to realize that would not play out the way I had planned largely because the living situation after moving was not at all what was expected. I did not realize that my uncle was struggling with his own situation because he never told my grandma as to avoid causing her to worry in the way she does. So my coming out to stay with him set in motion a series of events that would eventually lead to us bouncing from place to place, couch to couch and even homeless for a short period. Money became extremely tight and as such, we burned through my financial aid money to try to keep up with rent. Suffice to say that it was in this period that I lost any motivation and drive to focus on my school work and eventually failed enough classes to the point of me flunking out of college. It was and still is my greatest shame sometimes when I think about it.</p>
        <p>The question now though is am I <span id = "ashamed">______</span> because I failed myself or am I ashamed I failed to meet the expectations of everyone around me? You couldn't say that I wasn't smart enough because I had the grades to prove it. My academic strengths were part of what made me well known amongst my teachers and my peers. So then was the problem my inability to cope with the situation I was placed in? How much can I put the blame on how everything fell apart until it sounds like an excuse? I try not to hold it against my uncle because I can empathize with what he was going through as well but at the same time, I think if he had been forthcoming about what he was going through before I made the decision to come live with him, then I would have adjusted my plans accordingly and figured out another living situation that might have proved more stable. It is just quite difficult sometimes when I reflect on this time of my life and try to not feel like such a failure.</p>
